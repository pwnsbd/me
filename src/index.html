      Hello, fellow traveller!<br>
      <p class="answer-text">
      Looks like you found me in your strolling walk!<br>
      Just a confused guy, trying to figure out what to do. <br>
      A <a href="./photography.html" style=""> photographer</a> by heart and working as a software engineer. <br> 
      You can find my photographer work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pawan_subedi/">here</a>, which is also my personal account.<br>
      And you can find my github repo, <a href="https://github.com/pwnsbd">here</a>. <br>
      I like writing broken quotes.<br>
      But most interesting thing that I am currently working on is,
      <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/">Houdini</a> <br>
      You can see small progress, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alle_ory/">here</a><br>
      Mastering it slowly but surely!<br>
      I just got bored with lightroom and wanted to try something new.<br>
